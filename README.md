Here's a cleaner and more structured version of your README with improved clarity and formatting:

**Spatio-temporal Multimodal Wildfire Spread Prediction**  

## Setup  
Install the required dependencies using:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```  

## Downloading and Preparing the Dataset  
This repository uses the **WildfireSpreadTS** dataset, which is freely available at [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/8006177).  

To speed up training, convert the dataset to HDF5 format by running:  
```bash
python3 src/preprocess/CreateHDF5Dataset.py --data_dir YOUR_DATA_DIR --target_dir YOUR_TARGET_DIR
```  

## Running Experiments  
Run training with the following command:  
```bash
python3 train.py --config=cfgs/convlstm_cbam/full_run.yaml \
                 --trainer=cfgs/trainer_single_gpu.yaml \
                 --data=cfgs/data_monotemporal_full_features.yaml \
                 --seed_everything=0 \
                 --trainer.max_epochs=200 \
                 --do_test=True \
                 --data.data_dir YOUR_DATA_DIR \
                 --model_name YOUR_MODEL_NAME
```  

## Citations  
- The **WSTS** module was forked from [SebastianGer/WildfireSpreadTS](https://github.com/SebastianGer/WildfireSpreadTS.git).  
- All code related to the **CBAM architecture** is our own.

This version improves readability, formatting, and clarity. Let me know if you need any tweaks! 🚀

## Project Organization
The most up-to-date code compatible with the **WildfireSpreadTS** dataset is currently located in **WSTS**. Since we recently transitioned datasets, we are in the process of migrating documents from **WSTS** to our main module, **FireNet**.
